\# 🩺 Heart Disease Prediction (UCI Dataset)



This is an end-to-end machine learning project built to predict the presence of heart disease using clinical data. The dataset used comes from the UCI Cleveland Heart Disease dataset.



\## 🧠 Problem



Can we predict whether a patient has heart disease based on 13 clinical attributes?



\## 📊 Dataset



\- Source: \[UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease)

\- Also available on \[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data)



\## 🛠️ Technologies Used



\- Python (Jupyter Notebook)

\- Pandas, NumPy

\- Matplotlib, Seaborn

\- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest)

\- Model evaluation: Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC

\- Hyperparameter tuning: RandomizedSearchCV



\## 📈 Workflow



1\. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

2\. Feature processing and encoding

3\. Model training (LogReg, KNN, RF)

4\. Hyperparameter tuning

5\. Model evaluation and comparison

6\. Final model selection



\## ✅ Results



Achieved over \*\*95% accuracy\*\* with Random Forest after hyperparameter tuning.



\## 🧭 Next Steps



\- Explore XGBoost or LightGBM

\- Apply feature selection techniques

\- Extend with time-based or external datasets
